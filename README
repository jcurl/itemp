This is a very simple example of writing a kernel driver. It does something useful however - it reads the
temperature of Intel CPUs using Intel's MSR (Machine Specific Register) for processors that support it.

It provides the following features:
* Registers in the /sys/class/itemp namespace so that udev can automatically create a /dev entry on module
  insertion
** The model is similar to that used by "msr" and "cpuid" drivers.
* A udev rule exists that you can copy to /etc/udev/rules.d
* ioctl() interface for reading the temperature per cpu node
** This module doesn't take into account hyperthreading. Reading the temperature on two cpu threads that
   belong to the same core should result in the same temperature. You should use CPUID to know if your
   machine supports hyperthreading or not.
* ioctl() interface for reading the temperature per cpu node


Work to do:
* Provide an option on the command line to define what the Tjmax value is (default is 100)
* Provide a /proc interface for reading the temperature for all cores
* Improve the build system.
